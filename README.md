# 01-VBA-Homework
This is my VBA homework for the USC Data analytics bootcamp

This vba code loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information.

  - The ticker symbol.

  - Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  - The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  - The total stock volume of the stock.

It also uses conditional formatting that highlights positive change in green and negative change in red.

The BONUS to this homework returns the stocks with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume".
